/* 
TCL (Transaction Control Language)
TCL is used to manage transactions in a database. Transactions are sequences of one or more SQL operations executed as a single unit of work. TCL commands help ensure data integrity and consistency
TCL commands are used to manage transactions, maintain ACID properties, and control the flow of data modifications.
TCL commands ensure the consistency and durability of data in a database.

WHAT ARE TCL COMMANDS
START TRANSACTION: Begins a new transaction.
COMMIT: Saves all changes made during the current transaction permanently.
ROLLBACK: Undoes all changes made during the current transaction.
SAVEPOINT: Sets a savepoint within the current transaction.
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT: Rolls back to a specific savepoint.

-- Creating the products table
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

-- Inserting the data into products table
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price)
 VALUES 
 ('Laptop', 1000.00),
 ('Smartphone', 500.00),
 ('Tablet', 300.00),
 ('Headphones', 390.00),
 ('watch', 90.00);
 
 # START TRANSACTION
--  A transaction begins with the START TRANSACTION statement. 
--  Changes made after this statement can be either committed (saved) or rolled back (undone).

-- command
--  # START THE TRANSACTION
START TRANSACTION;

-- Lets us upadte the price of the laptop
UPDATE products SET price = 900.00 WHERE product_name = 'Laptop';

-- Inserting a new product into the products table
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Ipad', 8200.00);

-- Right now the changes are not saved we can choose to commit or rollback the transaction

# COMMIT TRANSACTION
COMMIT;

-- With this command whatever changes we have made till now is saved permanently to the database.

# ROLL BACK THE TRANSACTION
-- lets take anither exampel to anither the rollback command.

-- Starting  a new transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Updating the price of the smartphone
UPDATE products SET price = 450.00 WHERE product_name = 'Smartphone';

-- Inserting another new product
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Headphones', 150.00);

-- Something went wrong, roll back the transaction
ROLLBACK;

/* 
So in the above example we didnt commit the changes. 
If you think that you have done something wrong then you can use rollback command and all the changes will be undone.alter
*/

# SAVEPOINT
-- A SAVEPOINT allows you to create a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back without affecting the entire transaction.

-- let us understand it will help of an exmaple

-- Starting a new transaction
START TRANSACTION;

-- Inserting a new product
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Monitor', 250.00);

-- Create a savepoint
SAVEPOINT sp1;

-- Insert another product
INSERT INTO products (product_name, price) VALUES ('Keyboard', 100.00);

-- Something went wrong, roll back to the savepoint
ROLLBACK TO sp1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;

-- In above exmaple the insertion of Monitor will be saved but the insertion of Keyboard will be undone when we rollback to the savepoint sp1.

/* TCL commands are crucial for maintaining data integrity and consistency, allowing you to manage and control transactions effectively.

What is Trigger
-- Triggers 

-- Trigger is a statement that a system executes automatically when there is any modification to the database
-- Triggers are used to specify certain integrity constraints and referential constraints that cannot be specified using the constraint mechanism of SQL

/* 
A view in MySQL is a virtual table that does not store data directly but derives its results from one or
 more underlying tables or other views. It is defined by a SELECT query, which acts as its "definition" or "view definition".
